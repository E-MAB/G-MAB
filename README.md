GMAB (Genetic Multi-Armed Bandits) is an innovative optimization algorithm designed to tackle stochastic problems with high efficiency. By combining genetic algorithms with multi-armed bandit mechanisms, GMAB offers a unique, reinforcement learning-based approach to solving complex, large-scale optimization issues. Whether you're working in operations research, machine learning, or data science, GMAB provides a robust, scalable solution for optimizing your stochastic models.

## Usage
To install GMAB, add the following to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
gmab = "0.1.0"
```

```rust
use gmab::gmab::Gmab;

fn your_function(x: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    // your function here
}

fn main() {
    fn main() {
        let bounds = vec![(1, 100), (1, 100)];
        let mut gmab = Gmab::new(your_function, bounds);
        let evaluation_budget = 10000;
        let result = gmab.optimize(eval_budget);
        println!("Result: {:?}", result);
    }
}
```
